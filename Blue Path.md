🛡️ Blue Team / SOC Learning Path (TryHackMe)

This repository tracks my Blue Team / SOC analyst learning journey using TryHackMe.
The goal is to build defensive security skills, document progress, and maintain a public portfolio of hands-on cybersecurity learning.

📘 Blue Team Overview
The Blue Team focuses on defending systems against cyber threats. This path covers:
-Security Operations Center (SOC) fundamentals
-Monitoring, detection, and incident response
-Log analysis, SIEM, EDR, and threat intelligence
-Real-world attack detection and investigation
